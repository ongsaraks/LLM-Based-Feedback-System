# LLM-Based Feedback Gathering System for Healthcare

This project implements a conversational AI system designed to collect and analyze patient feedback in a healthcare context.

---

## Problem Statement
Collecting patient feedback is often limited by manual surveys and low response quality.  
This project explores how large language models (LLMs) can be used to gather structured feedback through natural conversation.

---

## What I Did
- Designed the system flow for conversational feedback collection
- Integrated an LLM via API to analyze patient responses
- Applied few-shot prompting and prompt engineering
- Implemented speech-to-text and text-to-speech for voice interaction
- Converted conversation results into structured feedback scores

---

## Technologies Used
- Typhoon LLM API
- Python  
- Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech
- CSV data handling

---

## Outcome
- The system can converse with users, analyze responses, and generate satisfaction scores (1–5)
- Demonstrates a practical application of LLMs in service feedback scenarios

---

## Notes
This project was developed as part of a healthcare innovation context.  
Ethical considerations and data privacy are essential for real-world deployment.
